<h2>Blackguard</h2>
<p>BLACKGUARD: The Blackguard epitomizes evil and is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the Blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains "anti-paladins" due to their completely evil nature.</p>

<p>Advantages</p>
<p>– Immune to level drain and fear.</p>
<p>– May turn undead as a Paladin of the same level.</p>
<p>– May use Backstab ability, although for a lower damage multiplier than Thieves:</p>
<p>Level 1-8: x2</p>
<p>Level 9-16: x3</p>
<p>Level 17+: x4</p>

<p>– May use the Life Drain ability once per day. An extra use is gained at levels 8 and 12.</p>

<p>LIFE DRAIN: The blackguard saps the vitality of an unfortunate victim within touch range, draining 1 point of THAC0 and Damage (an additional point is drained per 5 levels up to a maximum of 5 points at 20th level), as well as 1 hit point per level, and adding it to <PRO_HISHER> maximum. The drained attributes last for 3 rounds + 1 round per level. Non-living beings, such as undead and constructs, are immune to the effects.</p>

<p>– May use the Poison Weapon ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1, one use at level 5, and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.</p>

<p>POISON WEAPON: The blackguard is capable of coating <PRO_HISHER> weapon for the next eight hours with a slow-acting but extremely potent poison. This poison deals damage and reduces the target's Constitution immediately and every following round for at least four rounds. After four rounds have passed, the target must make a Saving Throw vs. Death or remain poisoned for another four rounds. Therefore, the poison has the potential to last indefinitely as long as the target does not make a successful Saving Throw. The target may not die of Constitution loss caused by the poison.</p>

<p>1st level: Target suffers two poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. No save modifier.</p>
<p>6th level: Target suffers four poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. Save modifier of -1.</p>
<p>11th level: Target suffers six poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -2.</p>
<p>16th level: Target suffers eight poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -3.</p>
<p>21st level: Target suffers ten poison damage and loses three points of Constitution. Save modifier of -4.</p>

<p>– 3rd level: Gains the Aura of Despair passive ability.</p>

<p>AURA OF DESPAIR: Blackguards perpetually radiate a malignant aura, inflicting negative effects on all enemies within 15 feet of <PRO_HIMHER> based on the Blackguard's level. Non-living beings, such as undead and constructs, are unaffected.</p>
<p>  3rd - All enemies suffer a -1 penalty to Saving Throws and Morale and a -10% penalty to all damage dealt.</p>
<p>  9th - All enemies suffer a -2 penalty to Saving Throws and Morale and a -15% penalty to all damage dealt.</p>
<p>  15th - All enemies suffer a -3 penalty to Saving Throws and Morale and a -20% penalty to all damage dealt.</p>
<p>  21st - All enemies suffer a -4 penalty to Saving Throws and Morale and a -25% penalty to all damage dealt.</p>

<p>– 9th level: May memorize a small selection of Mage spells:</p>
<p>Level 1: Blindness, Larloch's Minor Drain</p>
<p>Level 2: Horror, Invisibility</p>
<p>Level 3: Vampiric Touch, Hold Undead</p>
<p>Level 4: Improved Invisibility, Contagion</p>

<p>– 12th level: May use the Fiendish Reckoning ability once per day.</p>

<p>FIENDISH RECKONING: The blackguard draws upon the power of their fiendish host, gaining a +4 bonus to THAC0, +30% damage dealt from all sources, and +20 bonus hit points for 3 rounds. Killing a creature while Fiendish Reckoning is in effect heals the blackguard for 20 hit points and resets the duration. However, if no creature is killed within the initial duration, the blackguard suffers 40 magical damage and incurs a -4 penalty to THAC0 and -50% penalty to all damage dealt for 6 rounds as punishment.</p>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<p>– Incurs a -2 penalty to Reputation.</p>
<p>– Alignment restricted to evil.</p>
<p>– May not cast Detect Evil.</p>
<p>– May not cast Protection From Evil as an innate ability.</p>
<p>– May not use the Lay on Hands ability.</p>
