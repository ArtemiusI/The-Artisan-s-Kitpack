<h2>Hivemaster (Druid)</h2>
<p>HIVEMASTER: The Hivemaster is a druid that focuses on fostering and protecting insects and arachnids, including giant versions thereof. Most commonly stylise themselves after either communal insects, such as ants or bees (hence the name), or predators like spiders, scorpions and dragonflies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>– Immunity to all poisons and the following spells: Web, Summon Insects, Insect Plague, Creeping Doom</p>
<p>– Gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against attacks made by spiders and is ignored by them unless they are provoked.</p>
<p>– May cast Web and Spider Spawn as 2nd and 4th level priest spells respectively.</p>
<p>– May use the Poison Weapon ability once per day. Gains another use at levels 7 and 14.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>POISON WEAPON: The hivemaster is capable of coating their weapon for the next eight hours with a slow-acting but extremely potent poison. This poison deals damage and reduces the target's Constitution immediately and every following round for at least four rounds. After four rounds have passed, the target must make a Saving Throw vs. Death or remain poisoned for another four rounds. Therefore, the poison has the potential to last indefinitely as long as the target does not make a successful Saving Throw. The target may not die of Constitution loss caused by the poison.</p>

  <p>6th level: Target suffers four poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. Save modifier of -1.</p>
