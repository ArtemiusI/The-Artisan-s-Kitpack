<h2>Dark Hunter (Ranger)</h2>
<p>DARK HUNTER: Dark Hunters use their skills in stealth and survival for the purposes of infiltration, espionage, and manhunting, though they are no less capable in direct combat when necessary. While regarded as rangers in name only by typical woodsmen, Dark Hunters tend to be more welcome in guilds and groups of power as assassins and intelligence gatherers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dark Hunters, unlike typical rangers, may be of any alignment and, as their skills are not bestowed by a deity like typical rangers, will never fall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ADVANTAGES:</p>
<p>– +25% to Move Silently and Hide In Shadows.</p>
<p>– May use Backstab ability, although for a lower damage multiplier than Thieves:</p>
<p>  Level 1-8: x2</p>
<p>  Level 9-16: x3</p>
<p>  Level 17+: x4</p>
<p>– May use the Poison Weapon ability once per day. Gains an additional use every 5 levels.</p>
<p>– +3 to hit and damage against humanoids.</p>
<p></p>
<p>POISON WEAPON: The dark hunter is capable of coating their weapon for the next eight hours with a slow-acting but extremely potent poison. This poison deals damage and reduces the target's Constitution immediately and every following round for at least four rounds. After four rounds have passed, the target must make a Saving Throw vs. Death or remain poisoned for another four rounds. Therefore, the poison has the potential to last indefinitely as long as the target does not make a successful Saving Throw. The target may not die of Constitution loss caused by the poison.</p>
  <p>1st level: Target suffers two poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. No save modifier.</p>
  <p>6th level: Target suffers four poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. Save modifier of -1.</p>
  <p>11th level: Target suffers six poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -2.</p>
  <p>16th level: Target suffers eight poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -3.</p>
  <p>21st level: Target suffers ten poison damage and loses three points of Constitution. Save modifier of -4.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- From 3rd level onwards, may use the Set Snare ability once per day with 50% chance of success, plus an additional 10% for every 3 levels gained thereafter. Gains extra uses every 6 levels thereafter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SET SNARE: Set a trap in the chosen location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps grow more powerful with the character's level and can only be triggered by enemies.</p>
<p>  1st Level: Deals 2d8+5 missile damage.</p>
<p>  11th Level: Deals 2d8+5 missile damage, plus 2d6 poison damage per round for the next 3 rounds.</p>
<p>  16th Level: Deals 3d8+5 missile damage, plus 4d8+2 fire damage.</p>

<p>- From 10th level onwards, may use the Set Manhunter Snare ability once per day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SET MANHUNTER SNARE: The Manhunter Snare is a powerful trap intended for crippling and tracking marks. This trap deals 10d10+20 missile damage and greatly reduces the victim's movement rate, as well as causing them to bleed uncontrollably, dealing an additional 24 damage over 4 rounds. Additionally, the target is revealed for the bleed duration, remaining visible outside of allies' vision range and are unable to enter stealth or become invisible.</p>
