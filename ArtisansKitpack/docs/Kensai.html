<h2>Kensai (Fighter)</h2>
<p>KENSAI: This class's name, which means "sword saint" in the common tongue, refers to a warrior who has been specially trained to be one with their weapon. The kensai is deadly, fast, and trained to fight without the protection of armor. (Note: Despite its common name, a Kensai may use any melee weapon with which they are proficient.)</p>

<p>Advantages:
<p>– Base Armor Class of 8.</p>
<p>– -1 bonus to Speed Factor every 4 levels.</p>
<p>– Gains a +10% bonus to all physical damage dealt.</p>
<p>– Gains the Ki Critical innate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KI CRITICAL: +2 bonus to critical hit rate. Gains an additional +2 at 10th level and +1 every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>– May use the Ki Focus ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KI FOCUS: All successful attacks within the next 12 seconds will never miss and deal 20% increased physical damage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>– From 3rd level onwards, may use the Defensive Fighting ability at will.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DEFENSIVE FIGHTING: The Kensai sets their base Armor Class to a value equal to 6 - (level/2 rounded up). This ability lasts indefinitely until deactivated. However, while Defensive Fighting is active, the Kensai loses his Ki Critical modifier, becomes unable to critically strike, and is unable to use Ki Strike or Ki Focus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>– From 5th level onwards, may use the Ki Strike ability once per round.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KI STRIKE: The Kensai's next attack within one round of casting the ability has a doubled Ki Critical modifier and deals maximum damage. The Kensai incurs a cumulative fatigue penalty upon landing the attack, the amount of which decreases as the Kensai gains levels. Ki Strike will fail if the Kensai is overly fatigued.</p>
<p></p>
<p>– From 10th level onwards, gains the Perfect Defense innate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PERFECT DEFENSE: When Defensive Fighting is active, the Kensai becomes immune to backstabs. Additionally, the Kensai gains a cumulative +2 bonus to Armor Class for each enemy within a 15-ft. range.</p>
<p></p>
<p>– From 15th level onwards, gains the Perfect Offense innate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PERFECT OFFENSE: The Kensai will no longer critically miss on an attack roll of 1.</p>
