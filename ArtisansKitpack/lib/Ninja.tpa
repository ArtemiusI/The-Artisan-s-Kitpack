  Level 5-6: 1d8
  Level 7-9: 1d10
  Level 10-14: 1d12
  Level 15-19: 2d8
  Level 20-24: 2d10
  Level 25+: 2d12
– Ki: The ninja's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki, which allows them to be treated as magical weapons of +1 enchantment at 4th level, +2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 16th level and +5 at 20th level. From 7th level, they are treated as silver weapons.
– Receives a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws. An additional +1 is gained at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
– The ninja gains a +1 bonus to base Armor Class per point of Wisdom above 12. They gain an additional +1 to AC at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
– Deflect Missiles: The ninja receives a +1 bonus to AC vs. missile attacks every 3 levels.
– May use the Smoke Bomb and Poison Weapon abilities once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 6 levels thereafter.

SMOKE BOMB: Creates a Smoke Cloud at the targeted location, blinding and halving the movement rate of all creatures within the area for as long as they remain within the cloud. The ninja is immune to the blindness effect of their own Smoke Cloud and are invisible so long as they remain within it. The cloud lasts for 2 rounds + 1 round per 6 levels.

POISON WEAPON: The ninja is capable of coating <PRO_HISHER> weapon for the next eight hours with a slow-acting but extremely potent poison. This poison deals damage and reduces the target's Constitution immediately and every following round for at least four rounds. After four rounds have passed, the target must make a Saving Throw vs. Death or remain poisoned for another four rounds. Therefore, the poison has the potential to last indefinitely as long as the target does not make a successful Saving Throw. The target may not die of Constitution loss caused by the poison.
  1st level: Target suffers two poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. No save modifier.
  6th level: Target suffers four poison damage and loses one point of Constitution. Save modifier of -1.
  11th level: Target suffers six poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -2.
  16th level: Target suffers eight poison damage and loses two points of Constitution. Save modifier of -3.
  21st level: Target suffers ten poison damage and loses three points of Constitution. Save modifier of -4.

– 6th level: The ninja may now throw two Smoke Bombs per use of the ability.
– 11th level: Diamond Body: The ninja permanently becomes immune to poison.
– 12th level: The ninja may now throw three Smoke Bombs per use of the ability.
– 14th level: May use Empty Body twice per day.

EMPTY BODY: The ninja gains the ability to fade from sight, granting them partial invisibility for one round per level. Attacks against the ninja suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the ninja's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus. The ninja also cannot be targeted by spells from creatures unless they can see through invisibility.

– 15th level: Inner Eye: The ninja becomes immune to critical hits while unarmed.
– 18th level: The ninja moves at twice their movement rate whilst within their Smoke Cloud.
– 22nd level: The ninja gains a x1 additional bonus to their Backstab multiplier, increased to x2 whilst within their Smoke Cloud.

– Hit Die: d6~)
