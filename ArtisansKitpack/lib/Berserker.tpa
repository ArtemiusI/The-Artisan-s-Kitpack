STRING_SET_EVALUATE kit_strref ~BERSERKER: This is a warrior who is in tune with <PRO_HISHER> animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable <PRO_HIMHER> to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality. This class is common amongst dwarves, known to them as the Battlerager.

Advantages:
– Immunity to fear, morale failure and involuntary berserk effects.
– Gains the In Extremis passive effect.

IN EXTREMIS: Berserkers revel in the thrill of carnage to a sadomasochistic degree, and fight harder when approaching death while most warriors would falter or retreat. While powerful, the berserker's technique is a double-edged sword – as the berserker accumulates more wounds in battle, their blows become increasingly deadly, yet their defense falters, becoming more vulnerable to further damage.
  >75% Hit Points: +2 to melee THAC0 and Damage, -2 penalty to Armor Class
  >50% Hit Points: +4 to melee THAC0 and Damage, -4 penalty to Armor Class
  >25% Hit Points: +8 to melee THAC0 and Damage, -6 penalty to Armor Class

– May use the Enrage ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

ENRAGE: The berserker taps into <PRO_HISHER> frenzy though sheer force of will. For the next two rounds, <PRO_HESHE> gains +15 maximum hit points, loses one hit point per second, and deals an additional +5% slashing, piercing and crushing damage for every 5% of their missing hit points (+100% at one hit point). If the remaining duration of Enrage is less than one round, melee attacks made by the berserker reset Enrage's duration to one round up to a maximum total duration of ten rounds. The hit point loss from Enrage will not reduce the berserker's hit points below one. The berserker cannot cast spells while Enraged.

– From 4th level onwards, may use the Reckless Frenzy ability at will.

RECKLESS FRENZY: The berserker deliberately injures <HIMHER>self, instantly reducing <PRO_HISHER> hit points to 70%, 45% or 20% of <PRO_HISHER> maximum. This ability has no effect if used while the berserker is already below the selected value.

– From 7th level onwards, the berserker gains +2/+4/+8 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate while under the effects of In Extremis.

– From 10th level onwards, the berserker's trance-like state makes <PRO_HIMHER> more likely to shrug off debilitating effects, gaining +2/+4/+8 to all Saving Throws while under the effects of In Extremis.

– From 14th level onwards, the berserker gains +0.5/+1/+2 bonus attacks per round while under the effects of In Extremis.

– From 20th level onwards, the berserker gains a +1/+3/+5 luck bonus to rolls on damage dealt and received while under the effects of In Extremis.

Disadvantages:
– Becomes winded for five rounds after using Enrage, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls. Additionally, the berserker is unable to Enrage or gain the benefits of In Extremis while winded.
– May not Specialize in ranged weapons.
– Alignment restricted to any non-lawful.~
