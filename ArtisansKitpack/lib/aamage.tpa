  SAY ~Arcane Archer / Mage~
  SAY ~ARCANE ARCHER/MAGE: This character can use the abilities of an Arcane Archer and a Mage, though they cannot cast spells while wearing armor.

ARCANE ARCHER: Master of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using magic to supplement their combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic. In a group, they can strike fear into an entire enemy army.

Advantages:

- May achieve grandmastery in longbows, shortbows or crossbows.
- +1 to hit with any missile weapon at level 1 and every 5 levels thereafter.
- Gains the Enhance Arrow ability.

ENHANCE ARROW: The arcane archer passively imbues <PRO_HISHER> arrows with magic. Projectiles launched by the arcane archer are always treated as weapons of +1 enchantment and deal one extra point of magic damage, increasing by one for every five levels gained to a maximum of +5 enchantment and five magic damage at 20th level. Additional damage is affected by the target's magic resistance.

- 3rd level: May use Entropic Shield once per day.

ENTROPIC SHIELD: A magical field glowing with a multicolored hue appears around the arcane archer, providing immunity to normal missiles and a -2 bonus to armor class against missile weapons for 1 round per level. This bonus increases to -4 at 10th level and -6 at 17th level.

- 5th level: May use Imbue Arrow ability three times per day.

IMBUE ARROW: Using arcane magic, the arcane archer enchants <PRO_HISHER> next missile within one round to explode, dealing 1d6 additional fire damage for every five levels gained thereafter in an area of effect.

- 9th level: May use Seeker Arrow ability once per day.

SEEKER ARROW: A skilled arcane archer can enchant <PRO_HISHER> arrows to strike its target unerringly. <PRO_HISHER> next missile attack within one round is a guaranteed critical hit and deals two points of extra damage for every five levels gained thereafter.

- 13th level: May use Phase Arrow ability once per day.

PHASE ARROW: An experienced arcane archer can enchant <PRO_HISHER> next arrow within one round to become an incorporeal missile that penetrates armor, reducing the target's missile resistance by 50% as well as their armor class vs. missiles by two points for every five levels gained thereafter.

- 17th level: May use Arrow of Death ability once per day.

ARROW OF DEATH: A master arcane archer can enchant <PRO_HISHER> next arrow within one round to instantly slay <PRO_HISHER> foe on a failed save vs. death. Target's saving throw penalty is increased by one for every 5 levels gained thereafter.

Disadvantages:

- THAC0 penalty of 2 when wielding a melee weapon.
- Race restricted to elf or half-elf.
- May not exceed proficiency (one slot) in weapons other than longbows and shortbows.
- May not exceed proficiency (one slot) in any weapon style.
- May not wear armor heavier than elven chain mail.~
