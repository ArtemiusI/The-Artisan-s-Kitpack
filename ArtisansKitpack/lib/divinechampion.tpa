    help          = RESOLVE_STR_REF(~DIVINE CHAMPION: The divine champion is the strong right arm of their deity. They serve as a guardian of holy sites, a protector of pilgrims and a leader of crusades. Though paladins fill these roles in many good-aligned churches, a divine champion can take up the banner of any deity, regardless of alignment or ethos. These holy warriors are loved by their patron's worshipers and hated by the church's enemies in equal measure.
  
Divine Champions may be of any alignment and will never fall, regardless of alignment or reputation.

Advantages:
– May achieve High Mastery (4 slots) in any weapon.
– Gains +1 to all Saving Throws at level 5 and every 5 levels gained thereafter.
– 2nd Level: May use the Smite Infidel ability once per day, gaining an additional use every 2 levels gained.

– 5th level: May use the Divine Wrath ability once per day.

DIVINE WRATH: The divine champion channels a portion of their deity’s power, gaining a +4 bonus to hit, damage and Saving Throws, +25% to all resistances, and an additional +2 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws against all creatures of a different moral alignment (good, neutral, evil) to their own. This ability lasts for one turn plus an additional round for each level gained.

Disadvantages:
– Does not gain additional Saving Throws with Charisma.
– Does not gain Aura of Courage.
– May not Turn Undead.
– May not use Smite Evil.
